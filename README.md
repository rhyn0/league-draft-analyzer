## Information

This project will subscribe to the belief that there exist 5 composition styles in League of Legends. *See below picture*

![comp_styles](data/comp%20styles.png)

### Attack

Hard engage, hyper sprint comps.

### Split

Compositions that favor map rotations and ability to out maneuver their opponents as they make solo plays.

### Siege

Desire to play like a trebuchet. Want to setup at objectives and lockdown their position as they annoy their opponents

### Protect

A hypercarry composition, usually 1 carry but can feature multiple. Lots of peel and a desire to stay in tight phalanx formation.

### Catch

Lots of easy/fast Crowd control, with burst damage to get quick kills and then play with player advantage.
